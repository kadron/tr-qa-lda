\par We present a generative model for a Question Answering system applied to a Turkish corpora. The problem is “answering a natural language question using relevant documents”. Topic modeling using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to rank the similarities between a question and different passages in the document is a known method to solve this kind of problem as shown in the recent work of Celikyilmaz et. al. Their approach is multilingual however a morphologically rich language like Turkish might benefit a lot from a model that is fine tailored for such languages. \\
\par We propose a model that can handle the sparsity in MRLs (Morphological Rich Languages) better when compared to the original model. This model also takes syntactic properties (stems, inflectional affixes) into account because in MRLs substantial grammatical information, i.e., information concerning the arrangement of words into syntactic units or cues to syntactic relations, is expressed at word level. In the end, we apply both models to a Turkish corpora and compare the results. \\

  \headerbox{Motivation}{name=intro,column=0,below=abstract}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\par Question Answering (QA) is the task of automatic retrieval of an answer given a question. Usually processing the question, system receives several search phrases and uses those to find relevant documents from a corpora or a knowledge base.

\par Hazırcevap \cite{derici2014rule} is a Turkish question answering system designed for high-school students to assist their education. It is a rule based QA system that extracts parts of the question as a focus and the type and the character of the answer then is chosen based on these linguistically calculated focus words in the question.

\par In this project we aim to assist Hazırcevap in finding better answers by building a topic model relation between those focus words and the relevant documents.

  \headerbox{Original Model}{name=exp,column=1,span=1}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\par A passage in retrieved documents (document collection) is represented as a mixture of fixed topics, with topic $z$ getting weight $\theta^{(s)}_{z}$ in passage $s$ and each topic is a distribution over a finite vocabulary of words, with word $w$ having a probability $\phi^{(z)}_{w}$ in topic $z$. Placing symmetric Dirichlet priors on $\theta^{(s)}$ and $\phi^{(z)}$, where $\alpha$ and $\beta$, the generative model is given by:

\begin{equation*}
  \label{eq:dists}
  \begin{aligned}
    w_i|z_i, \phi_{wi}^{(z_i)} & \sim Discrete(\phi^{(z_i)}), \quad i = 1, ..., W \\
    \phi{(z)}  & \sim  Dirichlet(\beta), \quad z = 1, ..., K \\
    z_i | \theta^{(s_i)} & \sim  Discrete(\theta^{(s_i)}), \quad i = 1, ..., W \\
    \theta^{(s)} & \sim  Dirichlet(\alpha), \quad s = 1, ..., S \\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

	\par S is the number of passages, K is the total number of topics, W is the total number of words in the document collection, and $s_{i}$ and $z_{i}$ are passage and topic of the $i$th word $w_{i}$, respectively. \\

	\par Our goal is to calculate the expected posterior probabilities of a word in a candidate passage given a topic and expected posterior probability of topic mixings of a given passage, using the count matrices.  $n^{WK}_{w_{i}k}$ is the count of $w_{i}$ in topic $k$ and $n^{SK}_{sk}$ is the count of topic k in passage s.

\begin{equation*}
  \label{eq:model}
    \hat{ \phi}_{wi}^{(z_i)} = \frac{n^{WK}_{w_{i}k}+ \beta}{\sum^W_{j=1}n^{WK}_{w_{j}k}+ W \beta} \quad \hat{\theta}^{(s)} \frac{n^{SK}_{sk} +\alpha}{\sum^K_{j=1}n^{SK}_{sj}+ K \alpha}
\end{equation*}

	\par For comparison metric, we have used Information Retrieval Metric (IR) which is represented as follows. The advantage of IR over KL is that it is symmetric and there is no problem with infinite values because $\frac{p^{(z)}_{s}+p^{(z)}_{q}}{2} \neq 0$ if either $p^{(z)}_{s} \neq 0$ or $p^{(z)}_{q} \neq 0$

\begin{equation*}
  \label{eq:metric}
\begin{aligned}
&IR(p^{(z)}_{q},p^{(z)}_{s}) = \\
&KL(p^{(z)}_{q}||\frac{p^{(z)}_{s}+p^{(z)}_{q}}{2}) + KL(p^{(z)}_{s}||\frac{p^{(z)}_{s}+p^{(z)}_{q}}{2})
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

  \headerbox{Proposed Model}{name=proposed,column=2}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\par Recently the effects of applying different stemming techniques such as fixed-length word truncation and morphological analysis are explored in the area of document summarisation \cite{GaliotouKT13,can2008}. Following those studies we aim to overcome the data sparsity problem of morphologically rich languages by using different stemming approaches. 
%\par In our proposed model, the words in passages are transformed to their stems by using the method of identifying and removing inflectional affixes.\\

\headerbox{Dataset and Results}{name=results,column=3,row=0}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\par We have used the Turkish Wikipedia dataset as the corpus. Our dataset contains 50000 sentences and 50 questions to train the topics. We have processed the original dataset to obtain the dataset with inflectional affixes removed, and trained those two different datasets using LDA, and compared the questions and sentences using IR and posterior document-topic distributions. \\
\par After comparison of questions and sentences and obtaining 50 candidate passages for each question, we compare if the top 50 passages for each question contain the answers and define our success metric as \# of successful findings / \# of qustions. Original model performed with 70% \\
